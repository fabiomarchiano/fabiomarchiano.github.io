<a href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Weird-and-the-Eerie-101366154787666/" target="_blank">The Weird and Eerie</a> project arises from the narrative imagination of Fabio Marchiano (guitar, voice and lyrics) and the compositional creativity of Leonardo Fabini (electronics and drums). Everything can be seen as a musical transposition of cinematographic suggestions, readings and obsessing thoughts. We are all the stories we tell and we liked playing with that in this project.<br><br>
This <a href="https://soundcloud.com/theweirdandtheeerie/sets/the-weird-and-the-eerie-ep" target="_blank">EP</a> it’s the musical testimony of our brief but significant experience in the Black Lodge (hope you are a Twin Peaks fan too). We thank Bob for his bass solo in One Night Jack and lady log for her beatbox part in Jupiter’s junipers. Hope to see you soon (not really)

<blockquote>
Imagine a sky completely covered by clouds. Staring at it, with your nose up, your attention seems to be increasingly attracted by this soft and mutable mass. Everything starts to turn creating a passage; don’t look away, instead let yourself be carried out from the mass of cotton wool in which you are constantly immersed. This blanket opens in front of you, like a curtain, leaving space to a short vision.

1) WIDENING SKIES <br>
The eyes wander the horizon<br>
I feel that's not a boundary<br>
But a familiar red velvet<br>
Everything begins <br>
My gaze lost in the broad distances<br>
Find itself higher<br>
Plunged in a blanket of new light<br>
Sky falls <br>
Into pieces<br>
The curtains rises
<br><br>

<blockquote>
Nightclub, loud music and unbreathable air. It’s actually almost morning when a guy approaches you asking defiantly "do you want to see what’s under the blindfold that covers my eye?". It can be a revelation, it’s not the case to be touchy. Immediately after nodding, he raises his blindfold leaving you staring at a black void. Your attention is captured, you are ready to receive the message. Then he begins to tell his story. " I felt alone and I was strangely attracted to the woods at night. So every night I went out running. On one of those nights I stumbled, and a branch stuck straight into my right eye. I felt no pain. When I got to the hospital, I realized I couldn’t afford the surgery. Two days later, my friends gathered around me, made a fundraising and finally I got my intervention. Now I understand. Something lives in those woods and that night it made me a gift. But as it happens elsewhere no one gives you anything for nothing"

2) ONE NIGHT JACK <br>
Breathing  <br>
I was feeling hardwired <br>
Running through <br>
Just feeling the breeze  <br>
Start feeling wild <br>
Out here <br>
One step follows the other <br>
Milestones on the trail <br>
Shaping time  <br>
Moving gear is leading (out here) <br>
Have you ever had  <br>
The feeling that <br>
No one's here to make gifts <br>
To achieve what you need <br>
You have to give twice <br>
What you received <br>
One night Jack <br>
Told me  <br>
“It’s safe here, i don’t want to go back” <br>
In the woods you lose <br>
Part of you <br>
But you gain part of them <br>
<br><br>
<blockquote>
Few moments left to contemplate this alien landscape. A circular arrangement of Junipers emerges from the desolation of the dark earth. Within this circle projections of ancient rites are superimposed on present and future frames, which take their shape from the vapors rising from the earth. Along with the vapors a question seems to materialize: "And now? should I lose myself in this new path or should I go back?"

3) JUPITER'S JUNIPERS <br>
Surrounding junipers<br>
Hard and sharp needles<br>
Blueberries, fleshy cones<br>
Mist of smoke scents<br>
Opening the path <br>
For Jupiter<br>
Opening the path<br>
for Jupiter<br>
Surrounding junipers are<br>
Opening the path <br>
For Jupiter<br>
