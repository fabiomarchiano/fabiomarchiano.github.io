What is *Processing*?

<img src="/assets/img/processing.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

Processing is an open source programming library based on Java. Also Processing is the name of its IDE (integrated development environment)..reminds you something? yep, exactly as its younger brother, Arduino. This programming environment was initially developed at MIT Media Lab by Casey Reas and Ben Fry with the purpose of teaching the fundamentals of programming to non-programmers (visual designers, generative artists ecc.) in a visual context. It is a great tool to approach at once both programming and visual arts; moreover from 2001 it growed, became a foundation (along with Daniel Shiffman) with a huge community which developed also a JavaScript version of it (p5js) and more!

Who better than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman" target="_blank">Daniel Shiffman </a> can teach us about it? He's a great teacher and on his channel also he covers several topics which are really precious for everyone who is working on any project involving a PC (Git, machine learning ecc.).<br>
His coding train channel is just a a programmer's dream, full of rainbows and ideas!<br>

Moreover <a href="https://www.kadenze.com/courses/the-nature-of-code-ii/" target="_blank">here</a> there is another course made by him in which he teach us how to deal with physics and processing to realize animations (and <a href="https://natureofcode.com/book/introduction/" target="_blank">here</a> the freely available textbook of the course).

<a href="https://www.kadenze.com/courses/introduction-to-programming-for-the-visual-arts-with-p5-js-vi" target="_blank">Here</a> instead a great course of p5sj made directly by its developers (Casey Reas among them..), if you are a web developer you have definitely to take a look at that!

Here an example of usage of p5js: my version of the <a href="https://fabiomarchiano.github.io/projects/waveclock" target="_blank">Wave Clock</a>.
