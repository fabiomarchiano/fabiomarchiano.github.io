Hi and welcome to my page!




I'm a computational biologist, interested in system biology and gene regulation, working at the <a href="http://www.ibdm.univ-mrs.fr/" target="_blank">IBDM</a> (Developmental Biology Institute of Marseille).

I am currently doing a PhD in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/habermannlab/home" target="_blank">Computational Biology group</a> headed by B. Habermann. My role in the team spans from Genomics, Transcriptomics and Proteomics data analysis in support to collaborator's research groups to web-tool development towards visual data mining (<a href="http://mitoxplorer.ibdm.univ-mrs.fr/about.html" target="_blank">mitoXplorer</a>) and data integration (<a href="http://chimborazo.ibdm.univ-mrs.fr/AnnoMiner/index.html" target="_blank">AnnoMiner</a>). 
Actually my research topic focus on helping unravelling the role of mitochondria during ageing and sarcopenia (muscle loss) through the development of a web-based visual data mining platform (<a href="http://mitoxplorer.ibdm.univ-mrs.fr/about.html" target="_blank">mitoXplorer</a>) aimed to investigate the expression dynamics of mito-genes in different conditions and of a web-based tool to predict genes co-regulation by transcription factors (<a href="http://chimborazo.ibdm.univ-mrs.fr/AnnoMiner/index.html" target="_blank">AnnoMiner</a>).


I'm also developing several interests outside my academic research field such as: music, Generative Art and creative coding (Processing) and microcontrollers (Arduino). 

Don't hesitate to contact me for questions/collaborations or new ideas!
